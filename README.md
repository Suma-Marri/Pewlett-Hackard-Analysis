Many of their employees are beginning to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is looking foward to offer a retirement package for those who meet a certain criteria and analyze which positions will need to filled in the future. First we decided to take all their employee data from Excel and VBA and create an employee database with SQL. Afterwards, we decided to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program the help the manager prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami."

## Results

After getting the retiring employees' job titles, we realized that there are lots of positions that Pewlett Hackard needs to fill up, especially their Senior Engineers and Senior Staff, which is 64% of the total employees retiring. They have a total of 90,398 positions open and they need to start recuirting fast!  However, after they hire many employees for those postions, they need to train the new hires. So, Pewlett Hackard decided to start a mentorship program. However, after identifying the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program, we realized that we might not have enough mentors. We have 1,549 eligible employees to metor the new hires, which means that each mentor might have to train about 58-59 employees. Pewlett Hackard needs to change their eligiblility requirements so that they can have mentors for the new hires.
